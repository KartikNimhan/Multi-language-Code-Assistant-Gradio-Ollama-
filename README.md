# 🧠 Multi-language Code Assistant (Gradio + Ollama)

This project is a simple, interactive **code assistant interface** built using [Gradio](https://www.gradio.app/) and powered by a locally hosted large language model (`codeguru`) via the **Ollama** API (`localhost:11434`). It supports maintaining context across prompts to simulate a conversational coding assistant.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔄 Keeps prompt history for conversational context
- 🧠 Works with locally hosted models like `codeguru` via Ollama
- 🎨 Clean Gradio interface for easy interaction
- 🧩 Easily extensible to support other models

---

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) running a model like `codeguru` locally
- Packages:
  - `gradio`
  - `requests`

---

## 📦 Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KartikNimhan/Multi-language-Code-Assistant-Gradio-Ollama-.git
   cd Multi-language-Code-Assistant-Gradio-Ollama
````

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Start the Ollama server with your model:**

   ```bash
   ollama run codeguru
   ```

4. **Run the Gradio app:**

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## 🧪 Usage

* Type your prompt or code question in the input box.
* The assistant will respond with an answer generated by the local LLM.
* Each new prompt includes conversation history for better contextual answers.
